// The Statestore is a soft-state key-value store that maintains a set of Topics, which
// are maps from string keys to byte array values.
//
// Topics are subscribed to by subscribers, which are remote clients of the statestore
// which express an interest in some set of Topics. The statestore sends topic updates to
// subscribers via periodic heartbeat messages, which are also used to detect the liveness
// of a subscriber.
//
// Subscribers, in return, send topic updates to the statestore to merge with the current
// topic. These updates are then sent to all other subscribers in the next heartbeat.
//
// Topic entries usually have human-readable keys, and values which are some serialised
// representation of a data structure, e.g. a Thrift struct. The contents of a value's bye
// string is opaque to the statestore, which maintains no information about how to
// deserialise it. Subscribers must use convention to interpret each other's updates.
//
// A subscriber may have marked some updates that it made as 'transient', which implies
// that those entries should be deleted once the subscriber is no longer connected (this
// is judged by the statestore's failure-detector, which will mark a subscriber as failed
// when it has not responded to a number of successive heartbeats). Transience is tracked
// per-topic-per-subscriber, so two different subscribers may treat the same topic
// differently wrt to the transience of their updates.
//
// The statestore tracks the history of updates to each topic, with each topic update
// getting a sequentially increasing version number that is unique across the topic.
//
// Subscribers also track the max version of each topic which they have have successfully
// processed. The statestore can use this information to send a delta of updates to a
// subscriber, rather than all items in the topic.  For non-delta updates, the statestore
// will send an update that includes all values in the topic.
